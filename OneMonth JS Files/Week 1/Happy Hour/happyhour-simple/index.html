Since the random number is generated based on bars, which has more items, when a number for an item is called and the number don't exist on friends, then it will display undefined. We can fix it by A. adding/removing some items so bars and friends has the same amount of items. B. make the random a separate thing for each array.

			var randomNumber =Math.floor (Math.random()*bars.length); // 6. That is a nameplace object that contains static properties and methods for mathmetical constants and functions. In this case random is used to generates a random number between 0 and 6 (bars.length). 5.  The .floor means that it must be a whole number. When it is removed, it will likely generate decimals, then the two items can be selected and display undefined since they are labeled in whole numbers.

			var barname = bars[randomNumber]; //3. if you replace random number with 3, then the barname will be One Month since it is the 3rd (counting from 0) item in the array.
			var friendname = friends[randomNumber];

			document.write("How about you go to <strong>" + barname + "</strong> with <strong>" + friendname + "</strong>?");
			document.write(randomNumber); //1. this prints out the random number which is between 0-6 (the number of bars in the array). 2. A 0 is printed out sometimes because an array in code start with 0 not one.
			document.write(bars.length) //4. this prints out the number of items in the array.
